# 🐶 Pet Breeds Classification 🐱

🔎 Discover your pet breeds through a user-friendly web-based interface, and find a cat&amp;dog breed that looks like you!

The theme of our graduation project is classifying breeds of pets, especially dogs and cats. Sometimes I wonder what kind of cool dogs I encountered while taking a walk or what kind of cute cat I saw on Youtube. However, it is not easy to search by describing the appearance of the breed. "Cat with black face and feet" ←That's how it's hard to find the breed. In that case, if you use the image classification application we created, you can find out the breed of a dog or cat easily and interestingly with just one picture.

We created a web-based Python program that tells you what breed you have when you put pictures of dogs or cats. Furthermore, when a user enters a picture of his or her face, he or she adds a feature that shows the breed of a dog or cat that looks like him or her, adding to the fun of using the app.
