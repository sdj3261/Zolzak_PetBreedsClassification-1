# Zolzak_PetBreedsClassification
Discover your pet breeds through a user-friendly web-based interface, and find a cat&amp;dog breed that looks like you!

The theme of our graduation project is classifying breeds of pets, especially dogs and cats. Sometimes I wonder what kind of cool dogs I encountered while taking a walk or what kind of cute cat I saw on Youtube. However, it is not easy to search by describing the appearance of the breed. "Cat with black face and feet" ‚òú That's how it's hard to find the breed. In that case, if you use the image classification application we created, you can find out the breed of a dog or cat easily and interestingly with just one picture.

We created a web-based Python program that tells you what breed you have when you put pictures of dogs or cats. Furthermore, when a user enters a picture of his or her face, he or she adds a feature that shows the breed of a dog or cat that looks like him or her, adding to the fun of using the app.
